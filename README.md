book-catalogue
==============

A list of the books I own.

The `librarything` JSON is an export from my [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/tripofmice) catalogue, which now represents the canonical list of books I own (taking over from the now defunct `canonical.csv`).

The `goodreads` CSV is an export of my GoodReads data, which is the only place that stores the date I started a book and the date I finished it.

This data is merged, along with with [scraped LibraryThing data](https://github.com/mouse-reeve/book-scraper), in the [book-merger](https://github.com/mouse-reeve/book-merger) repository.
